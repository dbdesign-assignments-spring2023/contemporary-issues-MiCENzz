# Centralized or Decentralized, What is the Future of the Database's Form
In this document, I will discuss two different viewpoints about the form of databases: centralized or decentralized databases. 

## Article 1
In Analisse Weathers's [Benefits of a Centralized Database to Your Business](https://www.tmcnet.com/topics/articles/2021/11/05/450560-benefits-a-centralized-database-your-business.htm), the author lists serval advantages of centralized databases that could improve data management. To be more precise, the structure of cerntrailzed databases make data more secure, and allow for data integrity, better efficiency because of the improved reliability and speed in centralized databases.

In my opinion, author's viewpoints stands and I agree that the centralized form of  databases makes data management more efficient and secure. In fact, the centrailzed form database is widly used since last centry, which allowed users to directly access records.
Moreover, centralized database management enables organizations(schools, governments) to have better data quality and consistency.

## Article 2
In the artice [The Future of Data: Decentralized Database](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/reviews/altcoin-projects/the-future-of-data-decentralized-database/), Deepika Garg introduced a new form of database: decerntailzed database. While allows for data intergrity, there are problems caused by the cerntralized databases. The singe source input leads to a higher risk of misinformation. And there is a risk of data loss. Examples of 540 million Facebook user records stood exposed on the Amazon cloud server in 2019,and 7.5 million Adobe Creative Cloud account information stood exposed on October 26, 2019 illustrates the shortcoming of centralized databases. 

However, these shortcomings can be avoid by making databases decentralized, by using blockchain related technology. The author introduces severl decentralized databases such as Sia, Streamr, which allow for better data ownership and control. I understand  that decentralized databases offer a more distributed and secure approach to data management. By making databases decentralized, we can reduce the risks associated with the shortcomings of single source input.
